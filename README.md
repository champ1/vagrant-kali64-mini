==============
A « vanilla » Kali 64 vagrant box, without any tools on it.

### Raison d'être
* Keep your pentesting/hacking environment clean, separate from your main system.
* Automate boring tasks; manage your configuration files with Puppet/Chef.
* Open up the tools; ease security software development using Kali. 
* Empower users; forces us to understand what tools we use, what workflow we like, what features we need.

### Info
* Built with veewee.
* Small download size (~450MB) 
* Small memory footprint (~64MB)
* Accessed mainly from the CLI -- vagrant ssh.
* Provides userspace credentials (vagrant:vagrant)
